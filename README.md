# Tuner
This is a scratch my own itch project. I use potato for POTA hunting, and sotacracker for chasing SOTA.
So when I click on an activation in one of those apps, my radio will be changed to a new band, and on the spotted frequency.
So one does not want to tune up ontop of an activator. So I made this little app. What it does is remembers what frequency and mode you are on.
Then tunes the radio away to a fairly safe frequency. Which just coincidentally happens to be the start of the FT8 window for that band. No one uses that anyways...
Switches your mode to CW so you can key down to initiate a tune cycle, or press the tune button on your rig/tuner.
Once the cycle is complete, you press the tune button again, and the radio is changed back to the original frequency and mode you started on.
